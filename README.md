#Random Picture Sender bot for Telegram

This bot sends a random picture from a specified folder (subfolders included) to a subscribed user once in a fixed period of time. A user can change the period by typing a number.

Additionally, a user may request a random picture right away.

To use this program create a file called "token" in the script's folder and paste your bot's token into it. Then change the FOLDER variable to represent the path to your picture folder.
